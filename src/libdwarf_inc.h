//Most distributions install libdwarf.h to libdwarf/libdwarf.h to some reason
//There are some systems/situations (make install from the source if I remember correctly)
//in which libdwarf.h is not placed in a libdwarf directory. Therefore, this hacky conditional
//is needed to support both situations

#include "config.h"
#ifdef LIBDWARF_HEADER_NEEDS_PREFIX
#include <libdwarf/libdwarf.h>
#else
#include <libdwarf.h>
